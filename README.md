# UCB-Data-Bootcamp-WeatherPy

First, I randomly generated latitudes and longtitude coordinates.

Using citipy, I located the nearest city.

Next, I used OpenWeatherMap API to gain some weather information about each of the 500 cities.

Using the data, I created 4 different scatterplots:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
